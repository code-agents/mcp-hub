Several specialized tools are available to help secure your MCP applications. This page provides an overview of the most popular security tools and compares their features.

## <Icon icon="radar" iconType="solid" /> Available Security Tools

### MCP-Scan

MCP-Scan is a security scanning tool that inspects your MCP servers for common vulnerabilities like prompt injections, tool poisoning, and cross-origin escalations.

**Key Features:**
- Scans Claude, Cursor, Windsurf, and other file-based MCP client configurations
- Detects prompt injection attacks in tool descriptions
- Identifies tool poisoning vulnerabilities using Invariant Guardrails
- Detects cross-origin escalation attacks (tool shadowing)
- Implements "Tool Pinning" to prevent MCP rug pull attacks

**Usage:**
```bash
# Quick scan
uvx mcp-scan@latest

# Inspect tool descriptions
uvx mcp-scan@latest inspect

# Whitelist specific tools
uvx mcp-scan@latest whitelist NAME HASH
```

### MCPScan.ai

MCPScan.ai is a dedicated web-based security scanning service for MCP servers. It's a completely separate tool from MCP-Scan with its own feature set.

**Key Features:**
- Web-based vulnerability scanning for MCP servers
- Submit GitHub repository URLs for scanning
- Detailed reports on security issues
- Comprehensive knowledge base with vulnerability taxonomies 
- Remediation guidance for identified vulnerabilities
- Continuous monitoring options for enterprise users

**Access:**
Available via the [MCPScan.ai](https://mcpscan.ai) website

### Semgrep MCP

Semgrep MCP is a server that integrates Semgrep's powerful static analysis capabilities with MCP, allowing you to scan code for security vulnerabilities directly through MCP tools.

**Key Features:**
- Scans code for security vulnerabilities, bugs, and code quality issues
- Uses Semgrep's extensive rule sets and pattern matching
- Integrates with various MCP clients (VSCode, Cursor, Claude Desktop, etc.)
- Provides detailed scan results and remediation guidance

### Invariant Guardrails

Invariant Guardrails provides a layer of protection against prompt injection and other attacks on LLM-based applications, including MCPs.

**Key Features:**
- Defends against prompt injection attacks
- Provides real-time monitoring and detection
- Offers policy-based controls for LLM interactions
- Integrates with existing security workflows

## <Icon icon="shield-check" iconType="solid" /> Implementation Best Practices

<Tip>
**Security Recommendation**  
Use multiple security tools in combination for comprehensive protection. Choose MCP-Scan (CLI tool) or MCPScan.ai (web service) for MCP vulnerability scanning, Semgrep for code vulnerability detection, and Invariant Guardrails for runtime protection against attacks.
</Tip>

For optimal implementation of these security tools:

1. **Regular Scanning**: Run MCP-Scan CLI tool or use the MCPScan.ai web service regularly to detect new vulnerabilities
2. **Code Review**: Use Semgrep MCP during development to catch security issues early
3. **Runtime Protection**: Implement Invariant Guardrails for active protection against prompt injection
4. **Keep Updated**: Follow security updates for all MCP tools and libraries
5. **Whitelist Tools**: Use MCP-Scan's whitelist feature to authorize verified tools
6. **Continuous Monitoring**: For production environments, consider MCPScan.ai's enterprise monitoring option
