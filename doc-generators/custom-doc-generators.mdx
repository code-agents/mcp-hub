Beyond pre-built solutions, you can create your own **custom MCP documentation server** to index and serve private or specialized content that's tailored to your specific needs.

## <Icon icon="lightbulb" iconType="solid" /> Why Build Custom Documentation Servers?

While pre-built MCP-compatible generators and GitHub-powered MCP documentation servers cover many use cases, custom solutions offer unique advantages:

- **Private Documentation**: Secure access to sensitive internal documentation
- **Specialized Knowledge**: Index domain-specific knowledge bases
- **Custom Integrations**: Connect with proprietary systems and data sources
- **Fine-tuned Control**: Customize retrieval algorithms for your specific content structure

<Note>
  Custom documentation generators are ideal when you have unique requirements that aren't met by off-the-shelf solutions or when you need granular control over how your documentation is indexed and retrieved.
</Note>

## <Icon icon="cubes" iconType="solid" /> Examples of Custom MCP Documentation Servers

### Mastra MCP Documentation Server

The [Mastra MCP Documentation Server](https://mastra.ai/blog/introducing-mastra-mcp) is an excellent example of a custom-built solution. It enables AI agents to access a complete knowledge base without overwhelming their context windows, providing targeted information retrieval when needed.

Key features include:
- Real-time access to documentation
- Efficient context window utilization
- Support for complex query understanding
- Continuous updates to documentation without retraining

## <Icon icon="code" iconType="solid" /> Building Your Own MCP Documentation Server

Creating a custom MCP documentation server typically involves these components:

1. **Document Ingestion**: A system to collect and process your documentation
2. **Text Processing**: Chunking, embedding, and indexing your content
3. **Vector Database**: Storage for semantic search capabilities
4. **Retrieval System**: Logic for finding relevant information
5. **MCP Interface**: Endpoints that follow the MCP protocol

<Warning>
  Building a complete custom solution requires expertise in vector databases, embedding models, and MCP API specifications. Consider starting with managed tools that handle the infrastructure complexities.
</Warning>

## <Icon icon="cloud" iconType="solid" /> Using Managed RAG Solutions

Instead of building everything from scratch, you can leverage managed Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) services to create your MCP documentation server.

### Cloudflare AutoRAG

[Cloudflare AutoRAG](https://developers.cloudflare.com/autorag/) provides a fully-managed RAG pipeline that simplifies creating custom documentation systems.

Key benefits include:

- **Automated Indexing**: Continuously updates content without manual reprocessing
- **Built-in Similarity Caching**: Improves response time for repeated queries
- **Scalable Infrastructure**: Runs on Cloudflare's global network
- **Easy Integration**: Connect through Workers binding or REST API

<Info>
  GitMCP, mentioned in the GitHub-powered documentation servers category, is actually built on top of Cloudflare AutoRAG. This demonstrates how these managed RAG solutions can be used to create production-ready MCP documentation servers with relatively little effort.

  <Icon icon="lightbulb" iconType="solid" /> **How AutoRAG Works**
  
  AutoRAG handles two core processes:
  
  1. **Indexing (Asynchronous Background Process)**:
     - **Data Ingestion**: Reads from your connected data sources
     - **Markdown Conversion**: Converts various file types into structured Markdown
     - **Chunking**: Splits content into smaller pieces for better retrieval
     - **Embedding**: Transforms chunks into vectors using Workers AI models
     - **Vector Storage**: Stores vectors and metadata in Vectorize database
  
  2. **Querying (Real-time Synchronous Process)**:
     - **Query Rewriting**: Optionally improves search queries using LLMs
     - **Query Embedding**: Transforms queries into vectors for comparison
     - **Vector Matching**: Finds the most relevant content chunks
     - **Response Generation**: Uses retrieved context to generate accurate answers
</Info>

<Check>
  <Icon icon="check-double" iconType="solid" /> **Key Advantages of RAG with AutoRAG**
  
  - **Accuracy Without Training**: Get accurate answers based on your latest documentation without model training
  - **Reduced Hallucinations**: Ground AI responses in your actual documentation
  - **Source Attribution**: Trace responses back to specific documentation sources
  - **Knowledge Updates**: Documentation updates are automatically reflected in responses
  - **Efficient Context Usage**: Only relevant information is retrieved, maximizing context window usage
  - **Image Processing**: Can extract text and context from images in your documentation

## <Icon icon="diagram-project" iconType="solid" /> Implementation Steps

To create your own MCP documentation server using AutoRAG:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Configure Data Sources">
    Connect your documentation repositories, websites, or content stores. AutoRAG supports various sources including websites, GitHub repositories, and file storage systems.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Set Up Indexing">
    Configure chunking, embedding, and indexing settings. Determine how your content will be processed, including chunk size and overlap for optimal retrieval.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Define Retrieval Parameters">
    Customize relevance thresholds and context window parameters. Set the number of chunks to retrieve and minimum similarity scores to ensure accurate results.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Implement MCP Protocol">
    Wrap the AutoRAG responses in the MCP protocol format. Create endpoints that follow the MCP specification to enable seamless integration with AI assistants.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Deploy and Monitor">
    Launch your server and monitor performance. Track key metrics like query latency, relevance scores, and user satisfaction to continuously improve your documentation system.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  Start with a small subset of your documentation to test the system before scaling to your entire knowledge base.

## <Icon icon="circle-check" iconType="solid" color="#10B981" /> When to Choose Custom Solutions

Custom documentation generators are most valuable when:

- You have **sensitive information** that requires strict access controls
- Your content has **unique structures** that need specialized processing
- You need **specialized integration** with internal systems
- Standard solutions don't provide enough **flexibility** for your use case

By leveraging tools like Cloudflare AutoRAG or building custom infrastructure, you can create MCP-compatible documentation servers that perfectly align with your organization's needs while maintaining the efficiency advantages of the MCP approach.
