Documentation is a **critical component** of any successful MCP project. This section will help you choose the right tools for your documentation needs.

## <Icon icon="info-circle" iconType="solid" /> Overview

Documentation generators for MCP applications are specialized tools designed to create high-quality, interactive documentation that seamlessly integrates with AI assistants.

MCP documentation generators can be divided into three main categories:

## <Icon icon="chart-line" iconType="solid" /> Why MCP-Specific Generators Matter

<Note>
  MCP-compatible documentation generators offer significant advantages over traditional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approaches, particularly concerning context length efficiency.
</Note>

### <Icon icon="triangle-exclamation" iconType="solid" color="#EF4444" /> Traditional RAG Limitations

Traditional RAG often involves loading **large portions of documentation** into the AI's context window, much of which might be irrelevant to the specific task. This consumes valuable context space and can reduce the AI's focus.

### <Icon icon="puzzle-piece" iconType="solid" color="#3B82F6" /> MCP Advantages

In contrast, MCP allows AI agents and IDEs to **query specific pieces of information** from the documentation server *as needed*. Instead of pre-loading potentially irrelevant data, the agent retrieves only the necessary details (like API usage, examples, or changelogs) precisely when required.

### <Icon icon="bolt" iconType="solid" color="#10B981" /> Efficiency Benefits

This targeted retrieval keeps the context window lean and focused, leading to **faster and more efficient task completion** by the AI assistant. This approach mirrors the benefits seen with systems like the Mastra MCP documentation server, which enables agents to access a complete knowledge base without overwhelming their context.

<Warning>
  Using non-MCP-compatible documentation generators may result in less efficient context utilization and degraded AI assistant performance when working with complex projects.

## <Icon icon="check-circle" iconType="solid" color="#10B981" /> Recommendation

For the best results, choose a documentation generator **specifically designed** to work well with MCP systems and AI assistants. The right documentation tool will significantly enhance your AI assistant's ability to provide accurate, contextual help to users.
