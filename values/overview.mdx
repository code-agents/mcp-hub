# Our Values at MCPVerified

At MCPVerified, we have clear opinions on the technologies and practices that lead to successful MCP applications. These values guide our recommendations and content.

## Our Core Values

- **TypeScript First**: We believe TypeScript is the language of AI for production applications, offering the right balance of type safety and developer experience.

- **Performance Matters**: MCP applications should be built with performance in mind from the beginning, not as an afterthought.

- **Developer Experience**: Tools and frameworks should prioritize excellent DX while maintaining production quality.

- **Modular Architecture**: Components should be modular, reusable, and well-documented to promote ecosystem growth.

- **Serverless by Default**: Unless there's a compelling reason not to, serverless architectures provide the best scaling and maintenance profile for most MCP applications.

- **Security First**: We carefully vet recommended services, packages, and servers for security vulnerabilities and best practices.

- **Opinionated Curation**: We're not afraid to have strong opinions about what works best. Our recommendations are carefully curated based on real-world experience.

- **Official Packages Preferred**: When available, we recommend official packages and implementations over third-party alternatives for better support and reliability.

These opinions are based on our collective experience building MCP applications and represent what we believe are the best paths to success in this ecosystem.
