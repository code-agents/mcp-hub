# <Icon icon="wand-magic-sparkles" iconType="solid" color="#8B5CF6" /> Turn Existing APIs into MCP Servers

Many teams already have a fully-documented REST API described with **OpenAPI 3.0+**. Rather than re-writing that logic from scratch using a server framework, you can _generate a thin MCP proxy_ that forwards requests to your upstream API while speaking the **Model Context Protocol** to AI assistants.

These generators focus on **_existing_ services**, whereas the [framework comparison](./comparison) targets building **_new_ servers** from the ground-up.

<Callout type="info">
  <Icon icon="circle-info" iconType="solid" /> Use these tools when you _already_ own an OpenAPI spec and just want to expose it through MCP with minimal effort.
</Callout>

## <Icon icon="toolbox" iconType="solid" /> Available Generators

<GitHubPackageCards 
  packages={[
    {
      owner: "harsha-iiiv",
      repo: "openapi-mcp-generator",
      title: "openapi-mcp-generator",
      npmPackage: "openapi-mcp-generator"
    }
  ]}
/>

## <Icon icon="rocket" iconType="solid" /> Quick Start (stdio example)

```bash
# Install globally
npm i -g openapi-mcp-generator

# Generate a stdio MCP server from your OpenAPI file
openapi-mcp-generator \
  --input ./petstore.json \
  --output ./petstore-mcp

cd petstore-mcp && npm install && npm start
```

The CLI will:

1. Parse your OpenAPI document
2. Create a fully-typed TypeScript project with `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`
3. Generate Zod schemas for validation
4. Scaffold a `stdio` entry-point (or `web` / `streamable-http` based on flags)
5. Provide sample HTML clients for quick testing

## <Icon icon="check-circle" iconType="solid" color="#10B981" /> When to Choose Automatically-Generated Servers

- **Legacy REST APIs** needing AI integration fast
- **Backend teams** that don't want to learn MCP details
- **Prototyping** multiple microservices for LLM agents
- **Consistency** – guarantees your MCP contract stays in sync with the OpenAPI source

<Warning>
  Generated code is an excellent starting point, but you may still want to harden auth, logging, and error-handling before production use.
</Warning>

## <Icon icon="exclamation-triangle" iconType="solid" color="#F97316" /> Limitations & Pitfalls

<Callout type="warning">
  <Icon icon="triangle-exclamation" iconType="solid" /> **MCP ≠ simple REST proxy.** Automatically exposing every REST endpoint as a tool often **hurts LLM performance** more than it helps.
</Callout>

LLM experts (e.g. [David Cramer](https://x.com/zeeg/status/1913289979368796671)) warn that a naïve *OpenAPI-as-MCP* shim runs into several issues:

- **Tool overload:** LLMs struggle to pick from dozens (or hundreds) of endpoints. Slightly similar verbs (`create_post` vs `post_message`) cause frequent mis-selections.
- **Excessive parameters:** Classic REST endpoints expose many optional fields; the model must decide what to fill, *without UI context*.
- **Context limits:** Many models cap tool descriptions (~1 kB for some). Rich OpenAPI docs get truncated, losing critical guidance.
- **Response verbosity:** Machine-oriented JSON responses (IDs, uuids, nested data) are hard for models to interpret without additional reasoning.
- **Mismatch in abstractions:** Great MCP tools are designed around user-intent tasks ("Send a Slack message to #sales") rather than low-level CRUD endpoints.

<Tip>
  Treat the generated code as a **starting template**. Refactor the resulting tools, prune unnecessary endpoints, and wrap complex flows into higher-level, LLM-friendly actions.
</Tip>
