# MCP Marketplaces

MCP marketplaces provide platforms for discovering, distributing, and monetizing MCP components and applications. These specialized exchanges facilitate the growth of the MCP ecosystem.

## MCP-Specific Marketplaces

- **Glama**: Marketplace focused on model-agnostic components that work across different LLM providers
- **Mcpt**: Exchange platform for MCP templates, patterns, and reference architectures
- **MCP.so**: Community-driven registry of open-source MCP components with integrated testing and validation
- **Smithery**: End-to-end platform offering both marketplace and hosting for MCP applications

These dedicated MCP marketplaces help developers discover pre-built components, share their own creations, and accelerate development by building on existing solutions rather than starting from scratch.
